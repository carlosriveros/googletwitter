This project took about a month to develop and then had to be presented to an audience of members of local companies,
my university's computer science professors, and the public.

I worked mainly with the frontend, backend, and the database; I designed the database schema, I wrote all the code for the interaction with all the different APIs (Twitter Search, Twitter Trends, Yahoo Geolocation API).
I also created the code to filter the data and to store all relevant data into the database.
I created the code for the cron job.
On the front end side, I did all the JQuery interactivity.

My partners worked on the HTML/CSS Layout and created the code to make the 3D Models and KML files.

The project was completed succesfully by the deadline, and was successfully presented.
